# UTAT Remote Programming

This repo acts as a demonstration of the changes that need to be made to a standard NUCLEO-G474RE project, in order to make it work with [ST's dual-bank demonstration program](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/x-cube-dbfu.html). The final version of this repo will host all of the changes made to the original project, so that they can be emulated by UTAT Space Systems as needed.
