# UTAT Remote Programming

This repo acts as a demonstration of the changes that need to be made to a standard NUCLEO-G474RE devkit project, in order to make it work with [ST's dual-bank demonstration program](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/x-cube-dbfu.html), which uses the same MCU, but is designed for the STM32G474E-EVAL evaluation kit. The final version of this repo will host all of the changes made to the original project, so that they can be emulated by UTAT Space Systems as needed.
